GTK3 colour scheme for my caelestia dotfiles.
This works by using the `adw-gtk3` theme GTK named colours.

You need to restart the apps to reload the theme (idk why but live reloading doesn't work).

## Installation

Clone this repo to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/caelestia/gtk`.

## Usage

Control the colour scheme through the [main control script](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/scripts) for my dotfiles.

E.g.

```sh
caelestia scheme dynamic
```
