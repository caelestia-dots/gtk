# caelestia-gtk

![showcase](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/readme/blob/main/gtk/showcase.gif)

GTK3 colour scheme for my caelestia dotfiles.
This works by using the `adw-gtk3` theme GTK named colours.

You need to restart the apps to reload the theme (idk why but live reloading doesn't work).

## Installation

Install [`caelestia-scripts`](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/scripts.git),
then run `caelestia install gtk`.

## Usage

Control the colour scheme through the [main control script](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/scripts) for my dotfiles.

E.g.

```sh
caelestia scheme dynamic
```
